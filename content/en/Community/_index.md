### Set up Your Local Environment and Start Contributing

## Get Started

Below are directions for updating the CI/CD Cybersecurity Guide locally, and how to create your pull request. 

<br />

### The Hugo Server and Docsy

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate the website, the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site. 

Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organization in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

<br />

### Running the site locally

You can use the included [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to run the site locally.

1.  On Mac and Windows, download and install [Docker
    Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).  On Linux, install [Docker
    engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) and [Docker
    compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
   
    The installation might require you to reboot your computer for the changes to
    take effect. 

1. Build the docker image:

   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

1. Run the built image:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

1. Open the address `http://localhost:1313` in your web browser to load the
   docsy-example homepage. You can now make changes to the source files, those
   changes will be live-reloaded in your browser.

<br />

### To clean up your system and delete the container image:

1. Stop Docker Compose with **Ctrl + C**.

1. Remove the produced images

   ```bash
   docker compose rm
   ```

<br />

### Quick start with Netlify

Here's a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you're familiar with the GitHub workflow and you're happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:

1. Fork the [CI/CD Cybersecurity](https://github.com/cdfoundation/CICD-Cybersecurity/) on GitHub.
1. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).
1. If you're not yet ready for a review, add "WIP" to the PR name to indicate 
  it's a work in progress. (**Don't** add the Hugo property 
  "draft = true" to the page front matter, because that prevents the 
  auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.)
1. Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready,
  you should see a comment like this: **deploy/netlify â€” Deploy preview ready!**
1. Click **Details** to the right of "Deploy preview ready" to see a preview
  of your updates.
1. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with 
  the content.
1. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any
  "WIP" markers.

<br />

### Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
1. Follow the rest of the [Quick start with Netlify](#quick-start-with-netlify) process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.
