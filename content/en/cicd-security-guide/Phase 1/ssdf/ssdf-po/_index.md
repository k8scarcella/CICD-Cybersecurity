 Protect the Organization (PO) CI/CD Steps

## Protect the Organization (PO)

Organizations should ensure that their people,
processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the
organization level. Many organizations will find some PO practices to also be applicable
to subsets of their software development, like individual development groups or projects.

### PO.2 Implement Roles and Responsibilities

Ensure that everyone inside and outside of the organization involved in the SDLC is prepared to perform their SDLC-related roles and responsibilities throughout the SDLC.

<br>

<strong>PO.2.1</strong>: Create new roles and alter responsibilities for existing roles as needed to encompass all parts of the SDLC.Periodically review and maintain the defined roles and responsibilities, updating them as needed.

<br>


 _Designate a group of individuals as the code owners for each project, and review the list annually._

 <br>

- [Gitlab CODEOWNERS](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/codeowners/)

### PO.3 Implement Supporting Toolchains

Use automation to reduce human effort and improve the accuracy, reproducibility, usability, and comprehensiveness of security practices throughout the SDLC, as well as provide a way to document and demonstrate the use of these practices. Toolchains and tools may be used at different levels of the organization, such as organization-wide or project-specific, and may address a particular part of the SDLC, like a build pipeline.


<br>

<strong>PO.3.1:</strong> Specify which tools or tool types must or should be included in each toolchain to mitigate identified risks, as well as how the toolchain components are to be integrated with each other.

<br>

_Use software factories and/or software templates to standardize the toolchain._

<br>

<strong>PO.3.2:</strong> Follow recommended  security practices to deploy, operate, and maintain tools and toolchains.

<br>

_Use code-based configuration for toolchains (e.g., pipelines-as-code, toolchains-as-code)._

<br>

_Use existing tooling (e.g., workflow tracking, issue tracking, value stream mapping) to create an audit trail of the secure development-related actions that are performed for continuous improvement purposes. Record security check approvals, rejections, and exception requests as part of the workflow and tracking system._
