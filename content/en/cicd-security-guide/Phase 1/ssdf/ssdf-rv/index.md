### Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)

**RV.1 Identify and Confirm Vulnerabilities on an Ongoing Basis**

Task: Identify and Respond to Vulnerabilities
How to Achieve: Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities in their software releases and respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.
