## Introduction

As software moves from development to production, the build and deploy stages play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity, security, and provenance of your application. These phases involve compiling, packaging, and preparing your application for its live environment, making them prime targets for supply chain attacks, unauthorized modifications, and hidden vulnerabilities.

Integrating security into these phases ensures that your code is not only functional but also safeguarded against threats. From dynamic analysis during builds to automated scans for container security and misconfigurations, the right tools can help identify risks before deployment. Moreover, secure deployment pipelines prevent unauthorized changes, enforce compliance, and enable safe rollouts. 

To secure your build and deployment pipelines, you can leverage:

- Reproducible and Deterministic Builds - Ensure that software artifacts can be independently verified and reproduced to prevent tampering.
- Automated Threat Detection and Compliance Enforcement - Integrate continuous security analysis to detect misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized dependencies before deployment.
- Policy-Enforced Deployments - Enforce verifiable security policies ensuring only compliant, attested software reaches production.
- Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) - Secure build environments against tampering using hardware-backed execution environments.
- Cryptographic Attestation- Use digital signatures and cryptographic proofs to verify the authenticity and integrity of builds and deployments.

This page explores the key security tools and best practices for the build and deploy phase, ensuring your applications are delivered securely and maintain resilience in production environments. Learn how to protect your software, infrastructure, and users by embedding security into every step of your delivery process.

## Open Source Tooling

### SBOM Tools and Attestation
A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides visibility into software components, dependencies, and security risks**. When combined with attestation mechanisms, SBOMs enhance trust and traceability across the software supply chain.

### Open Source Build Signing and Verification
Ensuring software artifacts remain authentic and unmodified** is essential for a trusted software supply chain**. The following tools provide cryptographic verification** to protect against supply chain attacks**.

- [Notary](https://notaryproject.dev/)
- [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/)
- [GitHub Artifact Attestations](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-25-artifact-attestations-is-generally-available/)
- [The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/)

### Security-Enhanced Build and Deployment Tooling

Beyond open-source tools, a secure build and deploy pipeline relies on trusted execution environments, deterministic build systems, cryptographic verification, and policy-enforced deployment mechanisms. These technologies provide tamper-proof guarantees, verifiable attestations, and automated security policies to strengthen the software supply chain.

#### 1. Reproducible and Deterministic Build Systems  
Ensuring that software builds are reproducible enhances security by allowing independent verification of artifacts. These systems minimize non-determinism and ensure that a given input always produces the same output.

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
- [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/)
- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
- [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

#### 2. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Confidential Computing 
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide hardware-backed isolation to secure the build process, key management, and code execution. These environments ensure confidentiality and integrity in the build and deploy process and can be found in major cloud providers.

- [Intel TDX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html)
- [AMD SEV](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html)
- [Microsoft CCF (Confidential Consortium Framework)](https://github.com/microsoft/CCF)
- [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/)
- [Confidential Containers](https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers/)

#### 3. Cryptographic Signing and Verification  ensures authenticity, integrity, and provenance in the software supply chain.

- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
- [GnuPG (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/)
- [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/)
- [Keylime](https://keylime.dev/)
- [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org/)

#### 4. Secure Build and Deployment Policies
Automated security policy enforcement in CI/CD pipelines ensures only verifiably secure software is built and deployed.
