 Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV) in the Post-Deployment CI/CD Steps
---


### Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)

Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV): Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities
in their software releases and respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.



<br>

**RV.1**

<strong>Identify and Confirm Vulnerabilities on an Ongoing Basis: </strong> Help ensure that vulnerabilities are identified more quickly so that they can be remediated more quickly in accordance with risk, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF RV.1 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Continuously scanning live environments for new vulnerabilities

- Correlating detected vulnerabilities to deployed components and SBOM data

- Validating whether vulnerabilities are exploitable in the specific environment

- Prioritizing remediation based on severity, exploitability, and operational impact

      <p>RV.1.2: Review, analyze, and/or test the softwareâ€™s code to identify or  confirm the presence of previously undetected vulnerabilities.</p><br>
      <p>RV.1.3: Have a policy that addresses vulnerability disclosure and remediation, and implement the roles, responsibilities, and processes needed to support that policy.</p>

**RV.2**

<strong>Assess, Prioritize, and Remediate Vulnerabilities:</strong> Help ensure that
vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with risk to reduce the window of  opportunity for attackers.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF RV.2 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Determining which vulnerabilities matter most in the deployed context

- Using exploitability, business impact, and compliance requirements for prioritization

- Executing timely remediation or mitigation actions in live environments

- Tracking remediation status to closure with audit-ready records

<br>

To satisfy SSDF RV.3 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Determining whether it originated in coding, dependencies, build processes, or deployment configurations

- Documenting lessons learned to prevent recurrence

- Feeding analysis results back into security requirements, pipelines, and developer training
