 Protect the Organization (PO) Post Deployment

### Protect the Organization (PO)
Organizations should ensure that their people, processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the organization level. Many organizations will find some PO practices to also be applicable to subsets of their software development, like individual development groups or projects.

<br>

**PO.1**
<strong>Define Security Requirements for Software Development</strong>: Ensure that security requirements for software development are known at all times so that they can be taken into account throughout the SDLC and duplication of effort can be minimized because the requirements information can be collected once and shared. This includes requirements from internal sources (e.g., the organization’s policies, business objectives, and risk  management strategy) and external sources (e.g., applicable laws and regulations).

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.1 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts from just defining to:

- Maintaining and enforcing PO tasks in live systems.

- Making task requirements visible and traceable across deployed environments.

- Auditing and updating methods and procedures as internal and external policies change.

**PO.2**
<strong>Implement Roles and Responsibilities:</strong> Ensure that everyone inside and outside of the organization involved in the SDLC is prepared to perform their SDLC-related roles and responsibilities throughout the SDLC.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.2 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Defining and assigning roles for who is responsible for remediation and runtime configurations. 

- Maintaining evidence of what was deployed, who deployed it, and impact across all software assets.

- Ensuring security and patch management with restricted post-deployment actions.

**PO.3**
<strong>Implement Supporting Toolchains:</strong> Use automation to reduce human effort and improve the accuracy, reproducibility, usability, and comprehensiveness of security practices throughout the SDLC, as well as provide a way
to document and demonstrate the use of these practices. Toolchains and tools may be used at different levels of the organization, such as organization-wide or project-specific, and may address a particular part of the SDLC, like a
build pipeline.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.3 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Ensuring toolchains support vulnerability detection, SBOM tracking, compliance, and policy enforcement to function after release.

- Keeping automation tooling secure, updated, and integrated with the live environment.

- Maintaining evidence that the toolchain’s outputs (e.g., SBOMs, scan reports) remain trustworthy and current.

**PO.4**
<strong>Define and Use Criteria for Software Security Checks:</strong> Help ensure that the software resulting from the SDLC meets the organization’s expectations by defining and using criteria for checking the software’s security during development.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.4 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Ensuring that security data continues to be collected after release.

- Logs, SBOMs, and scan results are preserved and tamper-resistant.

- Data is safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access or modification.

- Data is retrievable for audits, investigations, and compliance checks

**PO.5**
<strong>Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development:</strong> Ensure that all components of the environments for software development are strongly protected from internal and external threats to prevent compromises of the
environments or the software being developed or maintained within them. Examples of environments for software development include development, build, test, and distribution environments.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.5 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- The security requirements for your development infrastructure are still relevant and enforced after software is released.

- Your build, deployment, and monitoring environments remain hardened and compliant.

- You continuously validate that your development infrastructure hasn’t drifted from its secure baseline.
