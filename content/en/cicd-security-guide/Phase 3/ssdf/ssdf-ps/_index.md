 Protect the Software (PS) Post-Deployment Steps
---

### Protect the Software (PS)
Protect the Software (PS): Organizations should protect all components of their
software from tampering and unauthorized access.

<br>

**PS.1**

<strong>Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering </strong>: Help prevent unauthorized changes to code, both inadvertent and intentional, which could circumvent or negate the intended security characteristics of the software. For code that is not intended to be publicly accessible, this helps prevent theft of the software and may make it more difficult or time-consuming for attackers to find vulnerabilities in the software.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PS.1 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts from just defining to:

- Protecting deployed artifacts (binaries, containers, scripts, configs) from being altered in production

- Ensuring post-deployment code integrity is verifiable at any time

- Maintaining secure storage, transport, and retrieval of code and artifacts

- Keeping an audit trail for all modifications and access

**PS.2**

<strong>Provide a Mechanism for Verifying Software Release Integrity:</strong> Help software acquirers ensure that the software they acquire is legitimate and has not been tampered with. Make software integrity verification information available to software acquirers.

<br>


To satisfy SSDF PS.2 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Keeping exact copies of every release artifact (binaries, containers, configs, SBOMs)

- Recording and publishing cryptographic verification data (signatures, hashes, attestations)

- Ensuring acquirers can confirm that what they have matches the trusted, official release

**PS.3**

<strong> Archive and Protect Each Software Release:</strong> Preserve software releases in order to help identify, analyze, and eliminate vulnerabilities discovered in the software after release.

<br>


To satisfy SSDF PS.3 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Keeping a tamper-proof record of every software component in each release

- Ensuring provenance data remains accessible for audits, investigations, and vulnerability response

- Allowing acquirers and downstream users to independently verify the origin and integrity of every component
