 Produce Well-Secured Software (PW) in the Post-Deployment CI/CD Steps
---

### Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)

Organizations should produce well-secured software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.

<br>

**PW.1**

<strong>Design Software to Meet Security Requirements and Mitigate Security Risks: </strong> Identify and evaluate the security requirements for the software; determine what security risks the software is likely to face during operation and how the software’s design and architecture should mitigate those risks; and justify any cases where risk-based analysis indicates that security requirements should be relaxed or waived. Addressing security requirements and risks during software design (secure by design) is key for improving software security and also helps improve development efficiency.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.1 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Keeping a tamper-proof record of every software component in each release

- Ensuring provenance data remains accessible for audits, investigations, and vulnerability response
- Allowing acquirers and downstream users to independently verify the origin and integrity of every component

      <p>PW.1.3: Where appropriate, build in support for using standardized security features and services (e.g., enabling software to integrate with existing log management, identity management, access control, and vulnerability management systems) instead of creating proprietary implementations of security features and services. </p>

<strong>Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information:</strong>Help ensure that the software will meet the security requirements and satisfactorily address the identified risk information.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.2 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Continuous verification that deployed code (source or binary) hasn’t been tampered with.

- Ongoing vulnerability assessment of deployed applications and components.

- Post-release code review triggers when a vulnerability or incident is detected.

- Auditable evidence that deployed software matches approved, reviewed code.

**PW.4**

<p><strong>Reuse Existing, Well-Secured Software When Feasible Instead of Duplicating Functionality :</strong> Lower the costs of software development, expedite software development, and decrease the likelihood of introducing additional security vulnerabilities into the software by reusing software modules and services that have already had their security posture checked. This is particularly important for software that implements security functionality, such as cryptographic modules and protocols.</p><br>
<p> Note: PW.3 moved to PW.4 </p>

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.4 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Vulnerability detection runs continuously on production or production-equivalent environments.

- Results are triaged and assigned quickly.

- There is an automated or semi-automated path to remediation (e.g., patching, image rebuild, or component upgrade).

- All activity is auditable and linked to release artifacts.

**PW.9**

<strong>Configure Software to Have Secure Settings by Default: </strong> Help improve the  security of the software at the time of installation to reduce the likelihood of the software being deployed with weak security settings, putting it at greater risk of compromise.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PW.9 in a post-deployment context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Check deployed software and infrastructure against the organization’s secure configuration baseline (e.g., NIST 800-53, CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs).

- Use policy-as-code and configuration management tools to keep deployed systems in compliance.

- Integrate configuration checks into runtime monitoring
