## Introduction

The post-deploy stage of your software delivery pipeline is where your application is live and actively serving users. While much of the focus in DevSecOps is on securing code, builds, and deployments, ensuring robust security doesn’t end there. The post-deploy phase is critical for monitoring, maintaining, and adapting to new threats in real time.

This phase includes tools and practices for continuous monitoring, vulnerability patch management, and incident response. From runtime application self-protection (RASP) to real-time threat detection and log analysis, post-deploy security ensures your application remains secure, compliant, and reliable in production.

Following are guidelines from industry frameworks with suggested open source tooling needed to achieve the compliance goals.
