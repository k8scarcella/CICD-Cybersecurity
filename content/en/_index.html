<strong>CI/CD Cybersecurity SIG from The Continuous Delivery Foundation</strong>

The CI/CD Cybersecurity SIG will play a pivotal role in advancing CI/CD security and supporting organizations in meeting modern cybersecurity demands. With focused efforts on integration frameworks, best practices, and emerging tooling, this SIG will address the critical need to embed security into every stage of the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring a resilient and secure software development lifecycle.

The mission of the SIG is to identify open-source security tools that seamlessly integrate into various stages of the CI/CD pipeline, enhancing cybersecurity throughout the software development lifecycle with speed and efficiency. As vulnerabilities continue to rise, it's crucial to evolve pipelines with robust security measures that establish stronger safeguards, protecting software from costly and devastating cyber breaches.

[Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) (CDF) serves as the vendor-neutral home of many of the fastest-growing projects for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD). It fosters vendor-neutral collaboration between the industry’s top developers, end users and vendors to further CI/CD practices and industry specifications. Its mission is to grow and sustain projects that are part of the broad and growing continuous delivery ecosystem. The CDF is part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) home to both the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) and [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org).
